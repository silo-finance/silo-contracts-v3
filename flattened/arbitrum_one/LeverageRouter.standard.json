Flashloaned USDC will be swapped into 1 ETH.\n    Contract will deposit 2 ETH as collateral and borrow 1000 USDC on your behalf against your ETH to repay flashloan.\n\n    Now you hold 2 ETH total exposure\n\n    - 1 ETH from your original deposit\n    - 1 ETH bought using flashloan funds\n\n    Your total ETH exposure is $2,000, but your own money is $1,000.\n\n    So, your leverage is: Leverage = Total Exposure / Your Own Capital = 2000 / 1000 = 2.0𝑥\n\n    RISK: If ETH price drops, your position can be liquidated.\n*/\nabstract contract LeverageUsingSiloFlashloan is\n

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
