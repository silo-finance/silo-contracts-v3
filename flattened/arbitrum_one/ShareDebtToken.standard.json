This contract extends\n/// the ERC20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n/// contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n///\n/// [CAUTION]\n/// ====\n/// In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n/// with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or\n/// inflation attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by\n/// making an initial deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible.\n/// Withdrawals may similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected\n/// slippage in general by verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks\n/// such as https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n///\n/// Since v4.9, this implementation uses virtual assets and shares to mitigate that risk. The `_decimalsOffset()`\n/// corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals and the vault\n/// decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which itself\n/// determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default offset\n/// (0) makes it non-profitable, as a result of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's\n/// donation) matching the attacker's expected gains. With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more\n/// expensive than it is profitable. More details about the underlying math can be found\n/// xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n///\n/// The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n/// to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n/// will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n/// bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n/// `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n///\n/// To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n/// ====\n///\n/// _Available since v4.7._\n/// @custom:security-contact security@silo.finance\nabstract contract ShareToken is ERC20PermitUpgradeable, IShareToken, IVersioned {\n    using Hook for uint24;\n    using CallBeforeQuoteLib for ISiloConfig.ConfigData;\n\n    string private constant _NAME = \"SiloShareTokenEIP712Name\";\n\n    modifier onlySilo() {\n        require(msg.sender == address(_getSilo()), OnlySilo());\n\n        _;\n    }\n\n    modifier onlyHookReceiver() {\n        require(\n            msg.sender == address(ShareTokenLib.getShareTokenStorage().hookSetup.hookReceiver),\n            ISilo.OnlyHookReceiver()\n        );\n\n        _;\n    }\n\n    /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\n    constructor() {\n        _disableInitializers();\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc IShareToken\n    function synchronizeHooks(uint24 _hooksBefore, uint24 _hooksAfter) external virtual onlySilo {\n        IShareToken.ShareTokenStorage storage $ = ShareTokenLib.getShareTokenStorage();\n\n        $.hookSetup.hooksBefore = _hooksBefore;\n        $.hookSetup.hooksAfter = _hooksAfter;\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc IShareToken\n    function forwardTransferFromNoChecks(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount)\n        external\n        virtual\n        onlyHookReceiver\n    {\n        IShareToken.ShareTokenStorage storage $ = ShareTokenLib.getShareTokenStorage();\n\n        $.transferWithChecks = false;\n        _transfer(_from, _to, _amount);\n        $.transferWithChecks = true;\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc IShareToken\n    function decimalsOffset() external view virtual returns (uint256) {\n        return SiloMathLib._DECIMALS_OFFSET;\n    }\n\n    function silo() external view virtual returns (ISilo) {\n        return _getSilo();\n    }\n\n    function siloConfig() external view virtual returns (ISiloConfig) {\n        return _getSiloConfig();\n    }\n\n    function hookSetup() external view virtual returns (HookSetup memory) {\n        return ShareTokenLib.getShareTokenStorage().hookSetup;\n    }\n\n    function hookReceiver() external view virtual returns (address) {\n        return ShareTokenLib.getShareTokenStorage().hookSetup.hookReceiver;\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc ERC20Upgradeable\n    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount)\n        public\n        virtual\n        override(ERC20Upgradeable, IERC20)\n        returns (bool result)\n    {\n        ISiloConfig siloConfigCached = _crossNonReentrantBefore();\n\n        result = ERC20Upgradeable.transferFrom(_from, _to, _amount);\n\n        siloConfigCached.turnOffReentrancyProtection();\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc ERC20Upgradeable\n    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount)\n        public\n        virtual\n        override(ERC20Upgradeable, IERC20)\n        returns (bool result)\n    {\n        ISiloConfig siloConfigCached = _crossNonReentrantBefore();\n\n        result = ERC20Upgradeable.transfer(_to, _amount);\n\n        siloConfigCached.turnOffReentrancyProtection();\n    }\n\n    function approve(address spender, uint256 value)\n        public\n        virtual\n        override(ERC20Upgradeable, IERC20)\n        returns (bool result)\n    {\n        NonReentrantLib.nonReentrant(_getSiloConfig());\n\n        result = ERC20Upgradeable.approve(spender, value);\n    }\n\n    /// @inheritdoc IERC20Permit\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) public virtual override {\n        NonReentrantLib.nonReentrant(_getSiloConfig());\n\n        ERC20PermitUpgradeable.permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s);\n    }\n\n    /* solhint-disable */\n    /// @notice Decimals are the same as underlaying asset.

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't\n * need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all.\n *\n * ==== Security Considerations\n *\n * There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature\n * expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n * considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n * take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n * generally recommended is:\n *\n * ```solidity\n * function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n *     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n *     doThing(..., value);\n * }\n *\n * function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n *     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n * `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
