This contract extends\n * the ERC-20 standard. Any additional extensions included along it would affect the \"shares\" token represented by this\n * contract and not the \"assets\" token which is an independent contract.\n *\n * [CAUTION]\n * ====\n * In empty (or nearly empty) ERC-4626 vaults, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning\n * with a \"donation\" to the vault that inflates the price of a share. This is variously known as a donation or inflation\n * attack and is essentially a problem of slippage. Vault deployers can protect against this attack by making an initial\n * deposit of a non-trivial amount of the asset, such that price manipulation becomes infeasible. Withdrawals may\n * similarly be affected by slippage. Users can protect against this attack as well as unexpected slippage in general by\n * verifying the amount received is as expected, using a wrapper that performs these checks such as\n * https://github.com/fei-protocol/ERC4626#erc4626router-and-base[ERC4626Router].\n *\n * Since v4.9, this implementation introduces configurable virtual assets and shares to help developers mitigate that risk.\n * The `_decimalsOffset()` corresponds to an offset in the decimal representation between the underlying asset's decimals\n * and the vault decimals. This offset also determines the rate of virtual shares to virtual assets in the vault, which\n * itself determines the initial exchange rate. While not fully preventing the attack, analysis shows that the default\n * offset (0) makes it non-profitable even if an attacker is able to capture value from multiple user deposits, as a result\n * of the value being captured by the virtual shares (out of the attacker's donation) matching the attacker's expected gains.\n * With a larger offset, the attack becomes orders of magnitude more expensive than it is profitable. More details about the\n * underlying math can be found xref:erc4626.adoc#inflation-attack[here].\n *\n * The drawback of this approach is that the virtual shares do capture (a very small) part of the value being accrued\n * to the vault. Also, if the vault experiences losses, the users try to exit the vault, the virtual shares and assets\n * will cause the first user to exit to experience reduced losses in detriment to the last users that will experience\n * bigger losses. Developers willing to revert back to the pre-v4.9 behavior just need to override the\n * `_convertToShares` and `_convertToAssets` functions.\n *\n * To learn more, check out our xref:ROOT:erc4626.adoc[ERC-4626 guide].\n * ====\n */\nabstract contract ERC4626 is ERC20, IERC4626 {\n    using Math for uint256;\n\n    IERC20 private immutable _asset;\n    uint8 private immutable _underlyingDecimals;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to deposit more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxDeposit(address receiver, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to mint more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxMint(address receiver, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to withdraw more assets than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxWithdraw(address owner, uint256 assets, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Attempted to redeem more shares than the max amount for `receiver`.\n     */\n    error ERC4626ExceededMaxRedeem(address owner, uint256 shares, uint256 max);\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Set the underlying asset contract.

The second is that because permits have\n * built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun.

(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.
